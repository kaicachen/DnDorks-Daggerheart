# DnDorks-Daggerheart

## Where to Place Files
When you are writing your DM notes, you should make a copy of any file that you want players to be able to reference in this vault
- One copy should live in a parent folder where you keep all of your DM notes
- One copy should live in the "Player View" folder
### Files for DM Use (Not Visible to Players)
- Create folder that is a direct child of the root "DnDorks-Daggerheart" folder
- Add the name of this folder to a new line in ".gitignore"
	- If there are spaces in the name of this folder, surround the name of the folder with single quotes 'like this'
	- This acts as a "negative key" to keep files hidden from players
### Files for Player Use (Visible to Everyone)
- Place in "Player View" folder
## Tags
Tags are used for referencing in Obsidian Bases (mini database queries)
### Files for Player Use (Visible to Everyone)
- Add the tag "playerview" to any files you want to be able to reference in Bases within the "Player View" folder
### Files for DM Use (Not Visible to Players)
- If you would like to add a "positive key" to your DM note files, then add a personal tag to your DM files such as "#\<name>dm"
	- This may be done in the event that after you have DM'd a session, you would like to share some or all of your notes, but would also like to ensure Bases reference the correct files
	- This will also help keep files from bleeding into other people's Bases

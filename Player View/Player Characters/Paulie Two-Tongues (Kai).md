## Overview:
- Ribbet Druid
- Stout, boisterous
## Wants:
- To expand the [[Frog Mafia]]'s operations to other islands
- To regain the trust of his fellow Frogs
## Fears:
- Permanent exile from his family and community
## General:
- Was unofficially cast out of his home island
- Is a slick talker, likes to make "friends" everywhere he goes
- Transforms into other frogs, never any other types of animals, to "keep it classy"
- Claims to be unprejudiced when it comes to race, but strongly believes in classic stereotypes
- Is a bit macho, some real toxic masculinity lives within him but is disguised behind the facade of a "gentleman"

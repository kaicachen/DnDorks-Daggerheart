### Backstory:
A 1' 8" tall Faerie, he resembles a blend of Dragonfly and Praying Mantis. Griffin is a lanky, grimy, mess of a creature.

Griffin was born on a massive forested island, into a full family. In multiple hundreds of siblings, and thousands upon thousands of cousins, Griffin the runt of his entire family.

All of his siblings have so far gone on to do incredible things. Slayed massive beasts, climbed impossibly high mountains, sailed the entirety of the ocean, delved into the great depths below, toppled nations. The list goes on and on of the amazing acts that those in his bloodline have accomplished. But Griffin was not blessed with large muscles, graceful agility, immense charisma, incredible understanding of lore, or anything really. Because of this he is easily the least favored of his siblings by his parents.

Knowing he could never match up to the prowess of his siblings, Griffin experimented with mechanisms. He began to learn how he could utilize machines to boost his attributes. He was able to enhance his exoskeleton to better protect himself from harm. But his greatest creation is a bolt action rifle. It allows him to be able to reload faster than the widespread muskets. And he continues to toil on, trying to create better equipment to maybe measure up to those he grew up with.

Despite his meek beginning in life, he is driven by his desire to become the greatest of his family, or at least gain the acceptance and love of his parents. He's not quite sure how he is to do that, but his sights are set to become the greatest pirate of all. To amass wealth and glory. He hopes to become well known throughout the land so that he can go home in triumph, and that his parents will finally be proud to call him a Pondhawk.

### Projects
Active:

Finished:
- Chitinous plating on his exoskeleton made from his family's molted shells.
- A bolt action rifle he refuses to part with.
- A Jolly Roger for the ship

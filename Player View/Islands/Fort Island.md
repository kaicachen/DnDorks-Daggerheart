A small island that is entirely taken up by a towering stone fort.

In the middle of the ocean sits a small but versatile fort controlled by [[The Storm Council]]. Where passing government ships are able to resupply, repair and rest. Its primary purpose is storage, not of supplies, but of prisoners. With countless holding cells for slaves, criminals, and most of all pirates.

Every few months, when every cell is occupied, there is a purge. Every inmate is chained together and led to a central courtyard where they are summarily executed.

![[Griffin's Home.jpg]]

A map of [[Griffin Pondhawk (Drexel)]]'s home that he drew in his youth.

A massive verdant forest island. With two large mountains in the epicenter.

Inhabited by different tribes of faeries, menacing arboreal creatures, and home to a few villages where Griffin was able to learn some of his trades.

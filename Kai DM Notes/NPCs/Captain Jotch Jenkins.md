## Overview:
- Former (and Rightful) Captain of The Drunken Delivery, also the ship cook
- Surly and haughty
- A skilled sailor and a trusted subcontractor in [[Kai DM Notes/General Notes/The Navy|The Navy]] slave trade out of the [[Isles of the Firbolg]].
- A large, dark green orc with short tusks, the left one broken
## Voice Prompt:
- Captain Jotch Jenkish, atchor shervish!
## Wants:
- To reclaim his ship and take the heads of the treacherous sea dogs who dared steal it
- To make a shitload of money
## Fears:
- The monsters that lurk in the deep (superstitious)
- [[Kai DM Notes/General Notes/The Navy|The Navy]] deciding that his services are no longer needed
## General:
- Is too powerful to easily fight on first meeting (partly because the party is all dehydrated and starving), so they may want to talk their way out of fighting him at first. Deception that they didn't steal his ship?

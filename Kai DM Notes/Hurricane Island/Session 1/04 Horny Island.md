# Overview:
## Initial Description:
Shaped like two crescent moons with concave curves facing each other, Horny Island is so named for its resemblance to a pair of horns, and no other reason. Across each opening to the inner bay stretch two gates that can sink into the sea to allow ships to pass through with strict surveillance.

Each crescent grows a different crop, one coffee and one sugar. The Fauna work as crew bosses and managers, while the Firbolg do the grunt work in the scorching heat and oppressive humidity.
## Key Groups:
The main populations include Fauna and Firbolgs of all ages. In general the Fauna seem more well fed and hearty, while the Firbolg all appear malnourished and sickly.

[[Kai DM Notes/General Notes/The Navy]] maintains a small force on this island, although it appears to mainly be to keep the Fauna and Firbolg under yoke and working the fields.

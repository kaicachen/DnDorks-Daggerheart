# A Confusing Account
This book has seen a lot of wear and tear over the years, and has clearly been used and reused across several different ships (illegal by Global Government standards).

The most recent entry describes the arrival of "[[The Drunken Delivery]]" to the Western port of [[Kai DM Notes/General Notes/Fort Island]]. [[Captain Jotch Jenkins]]'s account lists a cargo of "100 tonnes of spice", "four weeks worth of basic provisions", and notes the need to repair "a broken [evaporator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporator_(marine))".

> [!faq]- Question about Cargo (Easy History) 
>As far as you are aware, the [[Isles of the Firbolg]] produce little in the way of spices.

> [!faq]- Question about Cargo (Medium History) 
>It is a semi-open secret within [[Kai DM Notes/General Notes/The Navy]] that the [[Isles of the Firbolg]] are often raided by pirates for slaves to sell to [[Kai DM Notes/General Notes/The Navy]] and other high profile customers.

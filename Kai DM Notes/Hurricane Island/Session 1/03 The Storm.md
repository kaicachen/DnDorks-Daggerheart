# A Severe Squall:
It is twilight on the night of the second day adrift at sea. There has been no wind for hours, and even the night owls have drifted into the restless sleep of the dying, rocked by the lapping of the waves upon the hull.

A great CRACK jolts you awake, and you look around in terror at the darkness around you. The wind has picked up to an incredible speed, and the ship pitches forward on chopping waves ten feet tall. Ocean water sprays horizontal across your face and soaks your clothes. Any items that are unsecured on deck are being blown across the ship. You have one turn to grab what you can hold and throw them below deck to safety.

> The sound came from the sudden change in shape of the sail from slack to taut.

> [!faq]- Question about Sail (Medium Investigation)
> If you do not furl the sail soon, it will tear itself from the mast and fly away in the wind leaving you stranded with no way to move the ship after the storm. If you survive, that is.
## Questions:
- How does {character} react to being woken so suddenly?
- What is the first thing {character} would save in the event of a violent storm?
- What does {character} do to help minimize the risk of sinking in the storm?

Against all reason, the squall has lasted for minutes and the wind is only picking up speed. The sheer volume of the roaring is beginning to make your head pound. Your clothes cling to you and the wind sinks its freezing teeth into your bones. Those of you that weigh less than 100 pounds (DK, Paulie, and Gryphon?) feel yourselves begin to slide across the deck. You have one turn to find something to hold onto or some way to secure yourself to the ship.

> On the bow, there is the swiveling cannon. At midship there is the mast and shrouds. At the stern there is the ship's wheel and the door to the stairs leading down to the hull.

Just as you find purchase, you feel the stern rise sharply. A giant wave larger than the biggest castle you've ever seen is devouring the ship from behind. The Drunken Delivery pitches forward, and you feel your stomach churn as the entire vessel goes into freefall. A jolt surges through your body as the ship plunges into the trough before it. If you are above deck, make a strength check to see if you can hang on for dear life.

The ship continues to sink forward into the sea, then as if pulled by the moon itself, the rockets out of the sea and into the air. Higher and higher you climb, the wind ripping past as the stars turn into streaks in the night. You hear a scream rip through the night, but you can't tell where it came from. Your ears pop just as you begin to slow, then all is silent. You look around and see the night sky lit up closer and clearer than you've ever seen it before. You look below you and see an island, or maybe two, in the shape of crescent moons dancing in the night.

Then down, down, down you race back towards the sea. Faster and faster you rip through the night. With a thunderous BOOM you hit the sea and skid across the surface like rock thrown into a river. The ship slows with each impact, then just as you think the excitement is over, you feel the crash of hull on sand and you come to a shuddering stop on a beach unknown to you.

# Overview:
Former ship of [[Captain Jotch Jenkins]] and current ship of the party as of session one. A sloop of war resembling the [HMS Resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Resolution_(1771)).
## Notable Features:
A (currently broken) [evaporator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporator_(marine)) that would supply its crew with potable (if stale tasting) water by distilling seawater. Can be found by either siding with the [[Fauna Federalis]] and [[Kai DM Notes/General Notes/The Navy|The Navy]] to prevent a [[Firbolgs for Freedom]] uprising, or by overthrowing the Navy hold on [[201 Horny Island]]. Dealing with [[Fauna Federalis]] arbitrary for this objective?

There are two lower decks, the upper-lower deck containing crew quarters, and the lower-lower deck, located below the upper-lower deck, acting as a storage section. In the lower-lower deck are also four six-pound cannons, two on each side. There are two small quarter decks, one at the stern and one at the bow. The quarter deck at the stern houses a small Captain's quarters and the [[103 Ship's Log]]. On the quarter deck at the bow is a half-pound cannon on a swivel.

If you're having trouble remembering which side is port/starboard and which end is the bow/stern, remember these mnemonics: Bow forwards and stick out your rear end to stern people. If you extend the fingers on your right hand, there are five fingers, like the five points on a star(board). Your left hand is a spoil (s)port and disagrees that the thumb counts as a finger, so it only has four. And whoever heard of a four-pointed star?

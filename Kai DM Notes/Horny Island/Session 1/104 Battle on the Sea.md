# A Silly Skirmish
It is high noon on the second day at sea.

>[!faq] Is anyone up on the crow's nest?
>>[!info]- **Yes:**
>>A ship a good bit smaller than the sloop of war appears on the horizon and slowly closes in on you.
>
>>[!info]- **No:**
>>Paulie slumps against the railing on the upper deck, gazing out at the horizon. Suddenly he leaps to his feet, shouting: A FUCKIN SHIP! ALL HANDS ON DECK!

> [!faq]- Question about Ship (Easy Perception)
> You can see that the ship has strange proportions. It is short from bow to stern, and is taller than any ship you have seen before. It also has six large oars on either side as well as a sail that are working together to give the ship great speed.

> [!faq]- Question about Ship (Medium Perception)
> You can see around 6 or 7 pirates aboard the approaching vessel, and they appear to be wearing a wide variety of bright, garish colors. Three stand out from the rest, two who are obnoxiously large, and one who is wearing an obnoxiously large hat.

The ship cuts a steep angle and barrels towards you far faster than the slow winds will allow you to run. Conflict is inevitable. The ship will be within range of cannon fire within one turn, and upon you within three.
### Questions:

- How used to combat is {character}? How comfortable is {character} with large battles?

## A Sudden Stowaway:
You hear the sound of wood bursting into pieces and splintering across the deck. A massive green orc bursts forth from the planks of [[102 The Drunken Delivery|The Drunken Delivery]], shouting and yawning at the same time. *"What the blazes is going on? A bunch of ninnies dares attack MY ship? To hell with you, and begone!"* The orc leaps into the fray, landing ass-first onto the nearest clown and crushing his skull with a sickening *CRACK*.

## Victory at Last:
Talk to Captain Jotch for a while, then go back to relaxing

There isn't much in the way of provisions on the clowns' ship. It seems that most of the space on the ship was taken up by bodies, so they had no room to keep any food or supplies stocked.

# A Mysterious Island
Now that your eyes have adjusted to the darkness, you can see that the Firbolgs surrounding you look malnourished and haggard, and their mismatched armor appears old and rusted. None of them are wearing anything below the belt, instead letting their bits and pieces sway in the breeze, silhouetted by the bright flames behind them, with long shadows drawing monstrous visages in the sand between you. But the clubs and staffs they carry look dangerous yet, and the hard set of their faces tell you that these people are used to a tough life.

The four Firbolgs who sang to you step forward and regard you with suspicion. They stand arranged by height, and the tallest speaks first: *"Who are you, and where are your clothes?* he asks.
# REMEMBER:
Half island wears only pants, other half wears only shirts
Paulie initially lands on the Fauna crescent, and is captured by them for wearing only upper body clothing. The crew may decide to rescue him.
# Overview:
## Initial Description:
Shaped like two crescent moons with concave curves facing each other, Horny Island is so named for its resemblance to a pair of horns, and no other reason. Across each opening to the inner bay stretch two gates that can sink into the sea to allow ships to pass through with strict surveillance.

Each crescent grows a different crop, one coffee and one sugar. The Fauna work as crew bosses and managers, while the Firbolg do the grunt work in the scorching heat and oppressive humidity.
## Key Groups:
The main populations include Fauna and Firbolg of all ages. In general the Fauna seem more well fed and hearty, while the Firbolg all appear malnourished and sickly. The Fauna all only wear clothes below the belt, while the Firbolg only wear clothes above the belt. They are otherwise completely nude. Each group resents the other with an intense hatred because of this.

[[Kai DM Notes/General Notes/The Navy|The Navy]] maintains a small force on this island, although it appears to mainly be to keep the Fauna and Firbolg under yoke and working the fields.

# Overview:
## Initial Description:
Native lands of the Ribbet, base of operations of the [[Frog Mafia]], aand home of [[Paulie Two-Tongues (Kai)]], located to the Northwest of [[Kai DM Notes/General Notes/Fort Island]].

Made up almost entirely of flotsam (debris not deliberately thrown overboard, often the result of a shipwreck), the forest is approximately 80 thousand square miles (the size of Great Britain, that is England, Scotland, and Wales), but it is continually expanding. The forest originated in the doldrums (area of low pressure and light to no winds) around the equator, and thus has not floated astray from its rough geographical position since its inception.
## Key Groups:
The [[Frog Mafia]] is the major power in the area, although plenty of other peoples can be found here too, mainly sailors who have become stranded and indebted to the Mafia for rescuing them. The Mafia force those they save into work contracts that include near impossible quotas to reach freedom, turning any and all who are unlucky enough to survive being stranded in the Doldrums into indentured servants no better than slaves in all but name.

## Race:
Tortle
## Class:
Bard/Barbarian multiclass
## Short Backstory:
Semi-absent because of wrestling career, bought a shitload of lottery tickets to try to raise money to help his heel work partner (Bangos Jolly, Aarakocra) get the health care he needs to recover from his severe injury (paralysis). Bangos got injured during the big championship match, and Meepo was partially responsible, so he feels responsible for trying to help Bangos. Because of this, he's been gambling a lot more and taking sketchier matches for less pay to help raise money, and it's keeping him from spending time with his family. Any help offered by his Elven wife (who comes from old elven money) is shrugged off by Meepo because he wants to do it himself. He never got along with his wife's family, and because of this his wife is basically supporting herself and their son with the help of her parents, and any of Meepo's contributions are chump change. He is closeted and has feelings for Bangos, but pushed it down and ignored it in favor of his machismo. He never knew his parents because they were gone when he was hatched, but raised himself and had to be strong to survive on his own, enforcing his toxic masculinity. Their routine is that Bangos tries to steal his eggs, and Meepo stops him.
